Greetings! We're glad you're paying attention to our project. 

## What are we doing? 

The project will allow processing asynchronous tasks in code using http-cron approach (analog of RPC). For this purpose we are implementing a control panel, SDK in popular programming languages and technologies. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We plan to open the repositories as soon as they are ready.

First of all, we are working on creating a SaaS service. It will work on the Cloud-Native principle. Then we will provide a self-hosted version for the community. 

## About the team 

We are a team of like-minded people who want to make the world a better place! Working on OSS (open source software) is always interesting and provides valuable experience.
