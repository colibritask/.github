# Colibri Task

Greetings. We're glad you're paying attention to our project. 

> We are now actively working on our first implementation (MVP). 

## What are we doing? 

The project will allow processing asynchronous tasks in code using http-cron approach (analog of RPC). For this purpose we are implementing a control panel, SDK in popular programming languages and technologies. 

## About the team 

We are a team of like-minded people who want to make the world a better place! Working on OSS (open source software) is always interesting and provides valuable experience.
